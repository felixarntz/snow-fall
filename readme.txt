Adds a subtle snow fall effect to your website, using a lightweight web component.

== Description ==

This plugin adds a subtle snow fall effect to your website, using the lightweight `<snow-fall>` JavaScript web component by [Zach Leatherman](https://www.zachleat.com).

* [Learn more about the `<snow-fall>` component](https://www.zachleat.com/web/snow-fall)
* [Demo of the `<snow-fall>` component](https://zachleat.github.io/snow-fall/demo.html)

The plugin takes a no-frills, zero-config approach - you simply activate the plugin, and it just works - thanks to the excellent underlying web component implementation.

The plugin respects user preferences for reduced motion, as a best practice for accessibility.

This plugin doesn't come with a settings screen or options of any kind. You install it, and it just works.
